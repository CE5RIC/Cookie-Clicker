A Becode project

Created 4 buttons in HTML to start my project of an incremental game.
Started out with a click me button which increments the score by 1.
Afterwards came the reset button which sets the counter back to 0.
Added a function to the multiply button which multiplies the score by 2.

To do list:

- Creating some functionality where the multiplier isn't free.
  Therefore some sort of store with credits has to be created.

- After purchasing credit the score of the player has to be updated.
